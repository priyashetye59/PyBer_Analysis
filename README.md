### Observations
- As per above images of summary dataframe, it is clearly identifiable that major count of drivers and count is in Urban city type whereas on the other side, count of rides are lower in rural part but in comparion fares are high.
- In urban city, fare charged has shown a upward graph from January to May by observing some drastic downfall between March and April but considerably fares are high. While in rural part, fares are consistent throughout the period. 
- Above pie chart shows that byfare urban city has brought big revenue in pocket of PyBer and has maintained the leader scorecard in city types. 
## Recommendations
- As Fares are high in urban city, there should be a positive approach and steps to improve ride counts in urban area. Even though rides are higher in that city, efforts should be taken to attract more audience so there will be balance between rides and fare charged towards it which can turn in more revenue generation. 
- Fares in rural part should be adjusted to average fares of around $30 per ride which will help to boost the rides count there and attract more audience to use ride services in rural part.
- As a company, all teams should take a joint efforts and should focus on improving services in rural and suburban area which will help us to expand the business and generate reveneue and not to just stick on urban area for revenue generation.
